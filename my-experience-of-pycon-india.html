</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>This was my first PyCon India and in the following post I am going to share my experience and learning from the conference. Conference days took place on 2nd and 3rd October 2020.
Although the conference was online it was conducted really well and I enjoyed a lot attending it. There were folks from many different areas of the world who shared their knowledge and learnings in the talks, keynotes and many more events.</p>
<p>From live coding sessions in keynotes to talks about community, diversity, and bringing about positive change in the community. The esteemed keynote speakers have covered the spectrum of presenting some truly inspirational content at PyCon India.</p>
<h1>Keynotes</h1>
<p>All keynotes took place in stage Bengaluru. Each and every keynote was really nice and very educational but I would like to share one of the Keynotes in detail that were given by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sanand0/">Mr. S. Anand</a>. </p>
<h2>Keynote - Making Apps Seems Faster Without Optimizing</h2>
<p>Let us begin with the keynote of <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sanand0/">Mr. S. Anand</a>. CEO of Gramener, which was probably the best begining for the Conference. 
With "<em>Making Apps Seems Faster Without Optimizing</em>" as the topic, the talk was full of great knowledge. The concepts were based on the usability principle of Robustness.
So the concepts were summarised as :</p>
<h3>Prioritize :</h3>
<p>Show most important things first. <strong>Progressive enhancement</strong>. Calculate the most impactful change first.</p>
<h3>Update Users :</h3>
<p>Dont let the user see a blank black screen. Print the progress. At least users know the app is doing something. 
<strong>Logging()</strong> is more flexible. You can control levels, show time, and save logs. 
But <strong>tqdm()</strong> shows % completion whihc has a great appearence.
<strong>Websockets</strong> are a great way to share progress in web apps.
Set beatable expectations.</p>
<h3>Recover from errors :</h3>
<p>Continue from where they left off. Cache the calculations (<strong>SqliteDict</strong>) , and reload past calculations on re-start. Invalidate the cache if inputs have changed</p>
<h3>Pre Compute :</h3>
<p>Calculate common things upfront. Pre-compute things that don’t change much.</p>
<p>For the slides of the talk : <a href="https://github.com/sanand0/pyconindia2020/blob/master/pycon-india-2020-keynote.pptx">click here</a></p>
<p>I shared this one in such details because this was something that I actually could understand really well and am seriously looking forward to imply in my code.</p>
<h1>Talks</h1>
<p>This time the talks took place at different stages simultaneously ( Bengaluru, Pune, Chennai, Delhi and Hydrabad ) and every one of the talks I attended was very entertaining and educational. We had to choose that which stage we would like to get in and attend the talk of our choice. But I would have really liked it if I could attend all sessions live. But I also agree that conducting so many talks in two days and also providing recordings is in itself a great management.</p>
<p>So now let us discuss some of my favourite talks:</p>
<h2>Publishing well-formed Python packages by Julin S</h2>
<p>I enjoyed this talk a lot since I was learning how to package a my application and it was actually a great help for me at the time. I specially found the presentations to be designed really well. Also the communication skills were very good.</p>
<h2>Revolutionize the Web with Python - Brython by Antriksh Verma</h2>
<p>This one particularly caught my attention not only because of the great content and a solution for my future web app development but also because of seeing a kid with same age of mine giving the presentation and talk which is probably because I feel that as I am getting into a higher grade I keep on giving less stage talks and so I have started developing a small fear of speaking with or without a good preparation and that confidence. So yeah I enjoyed it too.</p>
<h2>Lightning talks</h2>
<p>I really appriciate the way people came in front and gave the presentation about how they implemented python in their life. It was very good to hear about those experience and I am pretty sure that it has given me a great inspiration for finding solutions for my small problems by python (programming).</p>
