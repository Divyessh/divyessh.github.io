</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <h1>Hello World</h1>
<p>With the interest in Mathematics and curosity to learn programming, about four months ago I started to learn Python. Python was the choice as it was the latest language that I knew and also the most trending. The absolute start was from <a href="https://youtube.com">YouTube</a>, a 3 hour tutorial and then many small and different lectures. After I learnt the basics, my interest to explore it and curosity both hiked up. Once I got a game tutorial in my YouTube recommendations. This made me create my first python game using the turtle library. Then I made a game with the turtle library and my imagination. I placed that game on a online source code market. In a month it was sold for around 10 USD and that was the moment which gave me the boost for exploring other feilds in python.</p>
<h1>Data and Science</h1>
<p>After making some good games, I wanted to explore more so my maternal Uncle <a href="https://in.linkedin.com/in/i-am-amit-maheshwari-pmp">Mr Amit</a> suggested me and I went on <a href="https://udemy.com">Udemy</a> and purchased a Data Science course with Mr Jose Portila as the instructor. It was the one that created my foundation. I learned the basics of most of the libraries in it like scikit-learn and tensorflow. My Uncle also asked me to make an account on the very famous platform known as <a href="https://stackoverflow.com">StackOverflow</a> where people can ask teir doubts and answer to the questions asked by others. This was also a big step for me as initially I was unable to answer a single question but as I practiced more I gradually started to answer question and started to build reputation(the points awarded by SO for answering questions). My another Uncle introduced me to <a href="https://in.linkedin.com/in/satyaakam">Mr Satyakam Goswami</a>. He is currently guiding and mentoring me through my journey.</p>
<h1>What next!</h1>
<p>On this Blog, I will share with you the problems I faced ( with solutions ), the learnings I have got so far and the next stations of this journey. So I hope that you will like to read them all and enjoy with me. See you soon!</p>
