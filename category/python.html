</footer><!-- /.post-info --><h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>'An application programming interface (API) is a computing interface which defines interactions between multiple software intermediaries.'</p>
<p>Today we are going to discuss about different API frameworks in Python.</p>
<p>Both Django and Flask are great frameworks.
Django comes in handy when a service depends on a database, needs a simple admin interface and perhaps a requires a nice web GUI. All that comes out of the box with Django thanks to its admin app and template engine.
When a simple micro-service that exposes a couple API Endpoints is needed, this is where Flask shines. Moreover, Flask can be easily extended, as there are a lot of external packages if we need templates.
However when it comes to RESTful microservices, both Flask and Django did not live up to expectations when it came to performance and development speed. This is when we found Fast API.</p>
<h1>Usage and Speed</h1>
<p>Here we are only concerned about a RESTful Micro-service, which would have the following as basic requirements. <br>
Exposes REST endpoint/s. <br>
OpenAPI(Swagger) documentation. <br>
Database connection (Optional).</p>
<h2>Django</h2>
<p>Django package does include REST API’s for that Django-rest-framework is your best option. It comes with a ton of features, but Open API generation is not among those features :). It comes with its own documentation for REST APIs though. For Open API documentation, drf-yasg or django-rest-swagger packages can be used. Trying to extend the documentation is quite painful with any of these and sometimes we even had to just use .yaml files instead.</p>
<h2>Flask</h2>
<p>No external packages are required to create REST endpoints with Flask however, for Open API documentation external packages like Flask-restplus can be utilised, However it usually generates outdated version of Open API documentation. But still it is a nice option.</p>
<h2>FastAPI</h2>
<p>Creating a REST API endpoint with Fast API and Open API takes less than a 5 minutes. It does not require any template. Changing the customizing documentation and adding validations is quite easy and it is explained in the documentation.</p>
<p>For documentation click <a href="https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/usage/schema/">here</a>.</p>
<p>Also it uses <code>uvicorn</code> or optionally <code>hyoercorn</code> as its ASGI servers, which makes it really user friendly. And when it comes to speed no other api framework can beat it.</p>
